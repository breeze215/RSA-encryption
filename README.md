# RSA-encryption
Code that carries out an effective RSA encryption algorithm on a message passed in by a user, showing all the steps in between.

The RSA algorithm itself isn't hard to code. However, it is the math and the encryption process behind it that many people struggle to grasp, I have attached a math file that shows my proof for the RSA algorithm, why it works the way it does and a small digrammatic explanation of the overall process.

*When computers carry out RSA encryption, much larger prime values are used for the values of p and q. Much smaller values have been used in my math document for the sake of the proof.
